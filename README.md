### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
My name is **NicolÃ¡s** and I'm from Paraguay.

I'm a **Full-stack** developer with 6+ years of experience developing web applications using mostly *PHP with Laravel, and JavaScript stack, focusing on ExpressJS, VueJS, and SQL databases*. At the moment I'm learning ReactJS and React Native to complement my stack.

Over the years I have been part of several teams of developers, from which I have learned a lot, for this reason, I have also invested my time in learning and certifying myself in SCRUM methodology; since this way, I can continue to add more value to any team.
I consider myself an enthusiast, who loves to learn and teach.

If you think I can help you in any way, don't hesitate to contact me. If you still have doubts, I leave you the links to my Linkedin profile and some practices of my Codewars profile.
